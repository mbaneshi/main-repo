This code defines the base class `Actor` within the `td::actor::core` namespace. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Constructor and Destructor:**
   - The class has a default constructor and a virtual destructor.
   - Copy constructor and move operations are deleted, indicating that instances of this class should not be copied or moved.

2. **ActorInfo Pointer:**
   - It has a member variable `actor_info_ptr_` of type `ActorInfoPtr` (presumably a smart pointer to some actor information).
   - There are setter and getter methods (`set_actor_info_ptr` and `get_actor_info_ptr`) to manipulate this pointer.

3. **Signal Handlers:**
   - The class has several virtual functions representing signal handlers, such as `start_up`, `tear_down`, `hangup`, `hangup_shared`, `wake_up`, and `alarm`.
   - These functions likely correspond to various events in the actor's lifecycle. For example, `start_up` is a handler for the startup signal, and `hangup` is a handler for the hangup signal.

4. **Useful Functions:**
   - The class provides several utility functions such as `yield`, `stop`, `alarm_timestamp`, `get_alarm_timestamp`, `get_name`, and `get_link_token`.
   - These functions seem to be related to managing the actor's behavior, signaling, and retrieving information.

5. **Private Section:**
   - The private section includes declarations of friend classes, such as `ActorExecutor`, `ActorMessageHangup`, and `ActorMessageHangupShared`. This suggests that these classes have privileged access to private members of the `Actor` class.

Overall, this `Actor` class appears to be a fundamental building block for the actor framework. It defines the basic structure and behavior that other classes, derived from it, might extend and specialize. The class seems to be part of a larger framework for concurrent and asynchronous programming, possibly within the context of a blockchain system like TON.

    What is a virtual constructor in C++?
    
  </summary>

  In C++, a "virtual constructor" is not a concept that exists in the language. The term "virtual constructor" is commonly associated with the idea of using a virtual function to create objects of a derived class through a pointer to a base class. However, C++ itself does not have a direct mechanism for virtual constructors.

The basic idea behind a virtual constructor-like behavior involves creating a virtual function in the base class that returns a new instance of a derived class. This way, when you call the function through a pointer to the base class, it can dynamically create an object of the appropriate derived class.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {}

    // "Virtual constructor" function
    virtual Base* create() const {
        return new Base(*this);  // Default: create a copy of the base class
    }

    virtual void someFunction() const {
        std::cout << "Base class function\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Override the "virtual constructor" function
    Derived* create() const override {
        return new Derived(*this);  // Create an instance of the derived class
    }

    // Override a function from the base class
    void someFunction() const override {
        std::cout << "Derived class function\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived;
    
    // Use the "virtual constructor" to create an object of the actual derived type
    Base* newObject = basePtr->create();
    
    // Call a function using the newly created object
    newObject->someFunction();
    
    delete basePtr;
    delete newObject;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Base` class has a virtual function `create`, which is intended to act as a "virtual constructor." The `Derived` class overrides this function to create an instance of the derived class. The `main` function demonstrates how you might use this mechanism to create objects based on the actual type of the object pointed to by a base class pointer.

It's important to note that this is not a standard idiom in C++ and is often not recommended. Instead, C++ generally relies on constructors for object creation. If you find yourself needing this pattern, it might be worth reconsidering your design to see if there's a more conventional and safer approach.

What is a virtual function in C++?

  </summary>
  

In C++, a virtual function is a member function of a class that can be overridden in derived classes, allowing objects of the derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class through pointers or references. This is a fundamental feature of polymorphism in C++.

Here are the key points about virtual functions:

1. **Declaration:**
   - Virtual functions are declared in the base class using the `virtual` keyword.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void someFunction() {
             // base class implementation
         }
     };
     ```

2. **Overriding:**
   - Derived classes can override the virtual function by providing their own implementation.
   - The `override` keyword is used in the derived class to indicate the intent to override a virtual function.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void someFunction() override {
             // derived class implementation
         }
     };
     ```

3. **Late Binding (Dynamic Binding):**
   - Virtual functions support late binding, which means that the actual function to be called is determined at runtime based on the type of the object rather than the type of the pointer or reference.
   - This allows for more flexible and extensible code.

4. **Syntax for Calling Virtual Functions:**
   - To call a virtual function, you use a pointer or reference to the base class, and the correct function is called based on the actual type of the object at runtime.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     Base* ptr = new Derived();
     ptr->someFunction(); // Calls the overridden function in Derived
     ```

5. **Pure Virtual Functions:**
   - A pure virtual function is a virtual function that is declared in the base class but has no implementation there. It is marked with `= 0`.
   - Classes containing pure virtual functions are abstract and cannot be instantiated.
   - Derived classes must provide implementations for all pure virtual functions.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     class AbstractBase {
     public:
         virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function
     };
     ```

Virtual functions are a key mechanism for achieving polymorphism in C++, enabling more flexible and maintainable code through the use of inheritance and dynamic dispatch.
