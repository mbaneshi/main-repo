#include "td/actor/core/ActorInfo.h"

using SchedulerMessage = ActorInfoPtr;
}  // namespace core
}  // namespace actor
}  // namespace td

The provided code snippet appears to be a C++ header file. Let's break it down:

1. **Header Guard:** `#pragma once` is a preprocessor directive that ensures the header file is included only once in a translation unit. It's a modern alternative to traditional header guards.

2. **Include Statement:** `#include "td/actor/core/ActorInfo.h"` includes the header file `ActorInfo.h` from the `td/actor/core` directory. This implies that the functionality defined in `ActorInfo.h` is needed in this file.

3. **Namespace Declarations:**
    - `namespace td`: This is the top-level namespace.
    - `namespace actor`: Nested namespace within `td`.
    - `namespace core`: Another nested namespace within `actor`. It seems to indicate that these declarations are part of the core functionality.

4. **Type Alias:** `using SchedulerMessage = ActorInfoPtr;` creates an alias `SchedulerMessage` for `ActorInfoPtr`. This is a way to provide a more descriptive name for a type, making the code more readable.

Given the context from your user profile, it looks like this code is part of a larger system related to actors and scheduling in a blockchain environment (TON - The Open Network). The `ActorInfo` and `SchedulerMessage` types suggest involvement in an actor-based system, which is a common paradigm for designing concurrent and distributed systems.

To get a more comprehensive understanding, it would be helpful to see the implementation details of the `ActorInfo` and other related components. If you have more specific questions or if there's additional code you'd like me to analyze, please provide that, and I'll be happy to assist further.
