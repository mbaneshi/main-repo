It looks like the provided code is defining two classes within the `td` namespace: `SchedulerId` and `CpuWorkerId`. These classes seem to be related to the actor framework, specifically in the `core` namespace.

Let's break down each class:

### SchedulerId Class:
- This class represents an identifier for a scheduler.
- It has a default constructor and a constructor that takes a `uint8` as an argument.
- The `is_valid` method checks if the `id_` member is greater than or equal to 0.
- The `value` method returns the `uint8` value of the `id_` member.
- The equality operator (`==`) compares two `SchedulerId` objects based on their `id_` values.

### CpuWorkerId Class:
- Similar to `SchedulerId`, this class represents an identifier, but specifically for a CPU worker.
- It also has a default constructor and a constructor that takes a `uint8` as an argument.
- The `is_valid` method checks if the `id_` member is greater than or equal to 0.
- The `value` method returns the `uint8` value of the `id_` member.
- The equality operator (`==`) compares two `CpuWorkerId` objects based on their `id_` values.

In summary, these classes provide a way to identify and work with schedulers and CPU workers within the actor framework. The `id_` member seems to play a crucial role in uniquely identifying instances of these classes. If you have specific questions or if you'd like to understand how these classes fit into the larger system, feel free to ask.
