This code appears to be part of a C++ library for actor-based concurrency, likely used in a larger system, possibly related to the blockchain code you mentioned earlier (TON - The Open Network). Let's break down the key components of this code:

1. **Header Includes:**
   - The code includes several headers related to actor execution, context, information, locker, messages, and signals.

2. **Namespace:**
   - The code is within the `td::actor::core` namespace.

3. **Class Definition: `ActorExecutor`:**
   - This class seems to be the executor responsible for managing the execution of an actor.
   - It has an inner `Options` struct, which allows configuration settings for the executor.
   - The constructor takes an `ActorInfo`, a `SchedulerDispatcher`, and `Options`.
   - The destructor (`~ActorExecutor`) includes a `finish` function, suggesting some cleanup.

4. **Public Member Functions:**
   - `is_closed()`: Determines if the actor is closed.
   - `can_send_immediate()`: Checks if an immediate message can be sent.
   - `send_immediate(F &&f, uint64 link_token)`: Sends an immediate message, possibly associated with a link token.
   - `send_immediate(ActorMessage message)`: Sends an immediate actor message.
   - `send_immediate(ActorSignals signals)`: Sends immediate actor signals.
   - `send(ActorMessage message)`: Sends an actor message.
   - `send(ActorSignals signals)`: Sends actor signals.

5. **Private Member Functions:**
   - `start() noexcept` and `finish() noexcept`: Handle the starting and finishing of the executor, possibly for initialization and cleanup.
   - `flush_one(ActorSignals &signals)`: Flushes one set of actor signals.
   - `flush_one_signal(ActorSignals &signals)`: Flushes one signal.
   - `flush_one_message()`: Flushes one actor message.
   - `flush_context_flags()`: Flushes context flags.

6. **Member Variables:**
   - `actor_info_`: Reference to actor information.
   - `dispatcher_`: Reference to a scheduler dispatcher.
   - `options_`: Configuration options for the actor executor.
   - `actor_locker_`: Manages actor locking and execution.
   - `actor_execute_context_`: Manages actor execution context.
   - `flags_`: Flags related to actor state.
   - `pending_signals_`: Pending signals for the actor.
   - `old_log_tag_`: A log tag for the actor.

This code seems to be a crucial part of an actor-based system, likely for concurrent and asynchronous processing. To understand it fully, you would need to look at its usage within the broader context of the TON blockchain code. If you have specific questions about certain parts of the code or its integration into the larger system, feel free to ask.
